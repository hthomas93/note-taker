## Purpose
The note taker app is a simple and streamlined solution to keeping your thoughts and tasks organized.

## User Story
AS A user, I want to be able to write and send notes.
I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before and add new ones
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks that I need to complete.

## How it works
When the app is run, the user will click the "Get Started" page. The app will deploy to either the user's local branch or the hosting server.
![landing page](./landingpage.png "Landing Page!")

This takes the user to the notes page.
![notes page](./notepage.png "Note Page!")

The user can then fill in the title and description of the note. Notice, a save icon will appear once both fields have been filled. Click this button to save the note.
![notes field](./notefield.png "Note Field")

Once the user has saved the note, it will appear on the sidebar. If you click the delete icon, the note will disappear.
